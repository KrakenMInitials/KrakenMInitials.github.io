Figma, Swagger, Spoonacular API, Tableau, Python                                            ‎                            | Jan 24, 2025 - Present  
-	a UI design purposed during PolyHacks 2025 to assist the Cal Poly food pantry in tracking stock levels, recommending recipes based on availability, and queue time monitoring
-	Hackathon entry for PolyHacks 2025, won “Best Demonstration” 
-	Played a major role in UI design of the project through Figma 

### Emulated UNIX file system in C 
C, VS Code, Valgrind, GDB                   | Oct 1 - Oct 21, 2024                                                                  
- Implemented single level file directory management with mkdir, touch, cd, ls commands
- String argument parsing/inodes and inode list/memory allocations/binary parsing/file access/file permissions    
- Read/wrote inodes and file information on a binary level in C
- Learned to solve memory leaks using Valgrind and debugging with GDB

### 2D Platformer ([link](https://editor.p5js.org/Willwrum/full/jkZAA0YGr))               
p5js, JSON                                           | Oct 18 – Dec 10, 2023                    
- In a team of 5, created a platformer. My work centered around mechanics of collisions, gravity, and movement of sprites	
Employed playtest feedback in development and produced a technical report on design process

### Downloader
- Replicated UNIX curl command to curl from a .txt file with multiple items to download
- Forked processes to handle x downloads at a time

### Assembly Interrupt/Exception Handling
RISC-V, RARS                                     |  May 29 - June 6, 2024
- Used polling to code read and print for strings and integers connected to an MMIO Simulator in RARS
- ASCII read from input and saved to memory or read from memory and printed to output
- Coded an assembly Interrupt Service Routine that mimicked the trap process in interrupt handling

### Database query tool
C, VS Code, Valgrind, GDB
- Parsed and operated a text file containing operations on a .csv file containing real demographics data from https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/ 
- Operations: display/filter-state/filter/population-total/population/percent
- C structures/malloc/realloc/free/s

### Little World Simulation 
Java, IntelliJ                                               | June - July, 2024 
- Dijkstra & A* Pathing Strategies/lambda functions and functional interfaces/code refactoring 

### Graph Implementation with Hash Functions                                                                                     
Git, Python, VS Code                          | Mar 7 - Mar 18, 2024 
- Vertex and edge creations and deletions/DFS Graph traversal/Hash table/linear probing hash collision 
resolution/graph representation & hash-table theory 

### Huffman Coding                                                                                                                               
Git, Python, VS Code                         | Feb 28 – Mar 7, 2024                                     
- Used a frequency Dictionary and priority queues to 
construct a Huffman Tree from a string input 
- Compressed the string using Huffman theory

### Big Number Calculator 
Java, IntelliJ                                        | Apr 15 - Apr 22, 2024 
- Used linked lists to bypass 32bit integer 
representation
- Programmed a calculator with addition, 
multiplication, and exponentiation functions 
- Included text file reading and parsing functions 
from which numbers were calculated
